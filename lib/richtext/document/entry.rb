# The Entry class extends the basic Node class and adds methods that make
# handling text a little nicer. Essentially the :text attribute is given
# special status by allowing it to a) be set during initialization, b) only
# visible in leaf nodes and c) copied over when adding children to leaf nodes.
#
# Some attributes are also supported explicitly by the inclusion of special
# accesser methods. The attributes are are bold, italic, underline, color and
# font.
